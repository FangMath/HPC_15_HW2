Bug1: The tag of message sent/received is not consistent. I modified the tag
to be tag=rank of the sending processor.

Bug2: The data type of message sent/received does not match. I modified the
data type received to be MPI_INT.

Bug3: The MPI environement isn't initialized and terminated by MPI_Init and
MPI_finalize functions respectively.

Bug4: The Master task doesn't call MPI_Reduce so that it is not included in
the MPI environment.

Bug5: The number of message sent is infinite, i.e. there is an infinite loop
of sending messages. I modified that the number of communications
is 500.

Bug6: It messed up the MPI_Wait. I changed the MPI_Waitall for all
non-blocking operations to single wait operations.

Bug7: **count = 1; is the length of data being broadcasted.


Problem 2:
Set the total number to be sorted be 1e6 and run the sample sorting of stampede, with different number of coresh
